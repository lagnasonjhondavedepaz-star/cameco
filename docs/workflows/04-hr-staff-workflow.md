## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Employee cannot find leave application status**
- Check if request was submitted (search in system)
- Verify if request is pending approval or already decided
- Check approval workflow (who needs to approve)
- Notify employee of current status

**Issue: Timekeeping exception not updating in payroll**
- Verify exception was logged in timekeeping module
- Check if payroll sync is enabled
- Notify Payroll Officer of manual adjustment needed
- Escalate to IT if system issue

**Issue: Document upload fails in HRIS**
- Check file size (max 5MB)
- Check file format (PDF preferred)
- Try compressing file if too large
- Contact IT if persistent issue

**Issue: Employee forgot RFID card**
- Allow manual time entry for the day
- Require supervisor approval
- Remind employee to bring card tomorrow
- Issue temporary card if repeated offense

## Immutable Ledger & Replay Monitoring

- HR Staff must reconcile manual entries against the PostgreSQL ledger (`rfid_ledger`) maintained by the Replayable Event-Log Verification Layer to ensure attendance integrity.
- Subscribe to the replay layer's alerting/metrics (ledger commit latency, sequence gaps, hash mismatches, replay backlog) so adjustments halt until underlying anomalies are cleared.
