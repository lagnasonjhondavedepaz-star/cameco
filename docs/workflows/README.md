## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Deployment
- **Type**: On-premise HRIS
- **Server**: Company server (internal use only)
- **Access**: Office staff with role-based permissions

### User Access
- **Office Staff**: Direct system access via web interface
- **Supervisors**: Submit paper records to HR Staff (no system access currently)
- **Employees**: Submit requests via paper/email to HR Staff (no system access currently)

### Integration Points
- **RFID Timekeeping**: Card tap → Edge device → Event bus → Timekeeping/Payroll/Notifications
- **ATS Sources**: Facebook, in-person applications, future: public job board
- **Payment Methods**: Current: Cash only | Future: Bank transfer, e-wallet

## Immutable Ledger & Replay Monitoring

- RFID/timekeeping signals referenced across these workflows live in the PostgreSQL ledger (`rfid_ledger`) enforced by the Replayable Event-Log Verification Layer.
- That layer emits its own alerting/metrics (ledger commit latency, sequence gaps, hash mismatches, replay backlog) and every role doc in this directory inherits the expectation to monitor/respond before executing dependent tasks.
