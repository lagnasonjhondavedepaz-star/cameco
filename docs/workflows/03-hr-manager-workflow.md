## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Leave request stuck in pending**
- Check if request requires Office Admin approval (6+ days)
- Verify no system errors in approval workflow
- Check if employee has sufficient balance
- Contact Office Admin if escalated

**Issue: Interview no-show**
- Review notification sent to applicant
- Check if interview details were clear
- Reschedule if legitimate reason
- Mark as "Failed to Appear" in ATS

**Issue: Performance rating distribution unrealistic (all 3s or all 5s)**
- Meet with supervisor to discuss ratings
- Explain forced distribution concept
- Request justification for outlier ratings
- Provide coaching on effective performance reviews

**Issue: Compliance audit finding**
- Document the issue thoroughly
- Create corrective action plan immediately
- Assign responsible person with deadline
- Escalate to Office Admin if critical
- Follow up until resolved

## Immutable Ledger & Replay Monitoring

- Attendance, overtime, and MDTR comparisons used in HR approvals must align with the PostgreSQL ledger (`rfid_ledger`) captured by the Replayable Event-Log Verification Layer.
- HR Managers should review the replay layer's alerting/metrics (ledger commit latency, sequence gaps, hash mismatches, replay backlog) before granting approvals tied to attendance or payroll-impacting actions.
