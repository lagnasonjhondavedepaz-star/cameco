# RFID Replayable Event-Log Verification Layer (Proposed)

> This document is the proposal companion to `rfid-integration.md`. It mirrors every diagram, flow, and checklist from the integration guide, but frames them around the tamper-resistant replay layer that is currently under evaluation as a patentable enhancement.

---

## Purpose
Create a tamper-resistant verification layer that sequences, hashes, and stores every RFID event in an append-only PostgreSQL ledger (`rfid_ledger`) before downstream modules consume them. This lets payroll and investigations deterministically replay past taps, reconcile Manual Daily Time Records (MDTR), and prove data integrity during audits.

## High-Level Architecture

**Architecture Pattern**: Event-Driven Architecture (Event Bus Pattern)

```mermaid
graph LR
    Employee([Employee]) -->|Taps RFID Card| EdgeDevice[RFID Edge Device<br/>Card Reader]
    EdgeDevice -->|Atomic Event| EventBus[Event Bus<br/>Message Queue]
    EventBus -->|Attendance Event| Timekeeping[Timekeeping Module]
    EventBus -->|Work Hours Event| Payroll[Payroll Module]
    EventBus -->|Notification Event| Notifications[Notification System]
    Timekeeping -->|Daily Records| HRStaff[HR Staff]
    Payroll -->|Payroll Period| PayrollOfficer[Payroll Officer]
    Notifications -->|Email/SMS| Employee
    style EventBus fill:#ff9800,color:#fff
    style EdgeDevice fill:#4caf50,color:#fff
    style Timekeeping fill:#2196f3,color:#fff
    style Payroll fill:#9c27b0,color:#fff
    style Notifications fill:#00bcd4,color:#fff
```

### Replayable Event-Log Extension

```mermaid
graph LR
  Employee([Employee]) -->|Tap| Edge
  Edge -->|Signed Event| EventBus
  EventBus -->|Fan-out| VerificationCore[Replayable Event-Log<br/>Verification Layer]
  VerificationCore -->|Append-only Entry| ImmutableLog[(PostgreSQL Ledger<br/>Hash-Chained Store)]
  VerificationCore --> AttendanceService
  VerificationCore --> PayrollService
  VerificationCore --> NotificationService
  MDTR[Manual Daily Time Record<br/>(Paper Submission)] -->|Cross-check| VerificationCore
  style VerificationCore fill:#673ab7,color:#fff
  style ImmutableLog fill:#455a64,color:#fff
```

Key capabilities:
- Assigns sequential IDs and cryptographic hashes to every RFID event.
- Persists events to an append-only PostgreSQL ledger enforced by row-level security.
- Cross-checks MDTR submissions and supports deterministic replay for investigations.
- Emits observability metrics so downstream payroll approvals halt when integrity issues are detected.

## Event Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Employee
    participant EdgeDevice as RFID Edge Device
    participant EventBus as Event Bus
    participant Timekeeping as Timekeeping Module
    participant Payroll as Payroll Module
    participant Notifications as Notification System
    Employee->>EdgeDevice: Tap RFID Card
    EdgeDevice->>EdgeDevice: Read & Validate Card
    alt Card Valid
        EdgeDevice->>EventBus: Publish Atomic Event {cardId, timestamp, deviceId}
        EventBus->>Timekeeping: Route to Timekeeping
        EventBus->>Payroll: Route to Payroll
        EventBus->>Notifications: Route to Notifications
        Timekeeping->>Timekeeping: Record Attendance
        Payroll->>Payroll: Update Work Hours
        Notifications->>Employee: Send Confirmation
        EdgeDevice->>Employee: Beep Success
    else Card Invalid
        EdgeDevice->>Employee: Beep Error
        EdgeDevice->>EventBus: Publish Error Event
        Notifications->>Employee: Send Error Notice
    end
```

## Atomic Event Summary

- Event schema:
  ```json
  {
    "eventId": "uuid-v4",
    "eventType": "rfid.card.tap",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-29T08:00:00.000Z",
    "deviceId": "edge-device-001",
    "cardId": "1234567890",
    "employeeId": "EMP-001",
    "tapType": "time_in"
  }
  ```
- Event types: `rfid.card.tap`, `rfid.card.invalid`, `rfid.device.offline`, `rfid.device.online`, `rfid.card.duplicate`.

---

## Module Touchpoints

- **Timekeeping Module**: Consumes `rfid.card.tap`, handles duplicate/edge cases.
- **Payroll Module**: Derives hours (regular, OT, late, undertime) from the ledger-backed stream.
- **Notification System**: Sends confirmations, invalid alerts, and device offline escalation.

---

## Device & Bus Configuration (Proposal inherits production setup)

- Edge devices: PoE-powered RFID readers with offline cache (1,000 events) and configurable retries.
- Event bus: Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ topics (`rfid.events.timekeeping`, etc.) retaining 7 days for quick replays.
- Publish API mirrors current deployment to avoid firmware changes; the proposal injects the verification layer immediately after the bus fan-out.

---

## Replay Layer Operations

### Ledger Schema (Append-Only)

- `rfid_events_ledger(sequence_id BIGINT PK, event_id UUID, payload JSONB, prev_hash BYTEA, curr_hash BYTEA, device_signature BYTEA, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ)`
- `replay_jobs(job_id UUID, mdtr_reference TEXT, replay_from BIGINT, replay_to BIGINT, discrepancy JSONB, state TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ)`

### Hashing & Signatures
- Uses `pgcrypto.digest(prev_hash || payload, 'sha256')` to create a tamper-evident chain.
- Optional Ed25519 signatures from edge devices prove message origin.

### Replay Engine
- Deterministic scanner streams ledger rows to downstream modules for investigations or MDTR reconciliation.
- Payroll approvals block automatically when:
  - Ledger commit latency exceeds 3s for >5 minutes.
  - Sequence gaps or hash mismatches are detected.
  - Replay backlog extends beyond two payroll periods.

### Audit Evidence
- Daily checksum snapshots exported to an on-prem WORM/object-lock target (e.g., MinIO Object Lock, NetApp SnapLock, Dell ECS) for legal defensibility.

## Monitoring & Alerts

| Layer | Metrics | Alert Threshold |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Device Health | publish success, cache usage, battery | failure >10%, cache >80%, battery <20% |
| Event Bus | throughput, latency, subscriber health | latency >5s, subscriber offline, failed deliveries >5% |
| Replay Layer | ledger commit latency, sequence gaps, hash mismatches, replay backlog, checksum export | latency >3s for 5 min, any gap/hash error, backlog >2 payrolls, checksum export failure |

---

## Troubleshooting Snapshot

- Card not reading → test on another device, replace card, or restart reader.
- Duplicate taps → automatically ignored if within 60 seconds.
- Offline devices → cached events replayed once online; verification layer preserves order via sequence IDs.
- Wrong employee tagged → reconcile via replay job referencing MDTR paperwork.

---

## Integration Checklist (Proposal Scope)

1. Hardware & software setup identical to production RFID integration.
2. HRIS modules subscribe to the ledger-backed stream for deterministic state.
3. Replay metrics wired into SigNoz/Grafana so operational teams can gate payroll actions.
4. Training updated to include MDTR replay procedures and patent-related handling.

---

## Novelty (Patent Candidate)

- Embeds a cryptographic ledger inside an HRIS timekeeping pipeline without relying on third-party blockchain services.
- Couples ledger health telemetry directly to payroll approval workflows, ensuring payouts never proceed on questionable data.
- Introduces replay job orchestration tailored for MDTR audits and labor disputes, drastically reducing investigation timelines.

---

## Next Steps

1. Prototype ledger schema & service; validate throughput (>25 events/sec) and hash-chain performance.
2. Instrument metrics to SigNoz (or Prometheus/Grafana) with the thresholds outlined above.
3. Draft MDTR reconciliation workflows that launch replay jobs and surface discrepancies to HR/Payroll dashboards.
4. Complete legal/patent narrative referencing this module once feasibility tests pass.
