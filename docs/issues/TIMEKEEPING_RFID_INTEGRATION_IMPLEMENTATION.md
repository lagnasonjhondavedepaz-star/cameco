?# Timekeeping Module - RFID Event-Driven Integration Implementation

**Issue Type:** Feature Implementation  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 weeks  
**Target Users:** HR Staff, HR Manager, Employees (via RFID scan)  
**Dependencies:** FastAPI RFID Server, PostgreSQL Ledger, Event Bus, Employee Module  
**Related Modules:** Payroll, Performance Appraisal, Workforce Management, Notifications

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Implement an event-driven Timekeeping system that pulls time logs from an append-only PostgreSQL ledger populated by a FastAPI RFID server. This system replaces manual time entry with automated RFID scanning and provides tamper-resistant, replayable event logs for payroll, performance appraisal, and compliance auditing.

**Core Objectives:**
1. Pull time logs from append-only PostgreSQL ledger (populated by FastAPI RFID server)
2. Create dedicated Ledger page for replayable event stream (separate from Overview)
3. Display overview analytics and summaries on Timekeeping Overview page
4. Implement MVC architecture with mock data in controllers (no separate API service)
5. Ensure data integrity with hash-chained, cryptographically verifiable events
6. Support ledger replay for reconciliation and audit purposes on dedicated Ledger page
7. Provide workforce coverage analytics and attendance monitoring
8. Generate attendance summaries for payroll processing

**Applied Implementation Decisions:**

**Architecture:**
- **MVC Pattern**: Controllers return Inertia responses with mock data for Phase 1
- **No Separate API**: Mock data lives in controllers, not separate service files
- **HR Routes Only**: All routes under `/hr/timekeeping/*` (no `/api` prefix)
- **Page Separation**: Overview page shows analytics/summaries, Ledger page shows full event stream with replay

**RFID Event Flow:**
- Employee scans RFID card at gate → FastAPI server receives scan → Saves to PostgreSQL ledger
- Laravel Timekeeping module polls/listens to ledger → Pulls new events → Processes into attendance records
- Event-driven dispatch to Payroll, Appraisal, and Notification modules
- Append-only ledger ensures tamper-resistance and audit trail

**Data Architecture:**
- **PostgreSQL Ledger Table**: `rfid_ledger` (append-only, hash-chained)
- **Attendance Events Table**: `attendance_events` (pulled from ledger, deduplicated)
- **Daily Summary Table**: `daily_attendance_summary` (aggregated for payroll)
- Sequence IDs ensure ordering; hash chains prevent tampering
- Replay engine for reconciliation and integrity verification

**Access Control:**
- **HR Staff**: View all attendance, manual corrections, import management
- **HR Manager**: View all attendance, approve corrections, analytics, export reports
- **Employees**: No direct access (scan RFID only; view own records via future portal)
- **System**: Automated ledger polling, event processing, and workflow gating

**Event-Driven Integration:**
- **Payroll Module**: Receives `AttendanceProcessed` events for salary calculations
- **Appraisal Module**: Receives `AttendanceViolation` events for performance scoring
- **Notification Module**: Sends alerts for late arrivals, absences, and violations
- **Workforce Module**: Coverage analytics based on real-time attendance data

**Compliance & Security:**
- DOLE labor law compliance (accurate time records for 5 years)
- Cryptographic hash chains for tamper-evidence
- Audit logging for manual corrections and ledger replay
- Automated snapshots to WORM storage for legal defensibility

## ✅ Implementation Decisions Applied

**FastAPI → PostgreSQL → Laravel Flow:**
1. RFID scanner captures employee card tap
2. FastAPI server receives scan, validates employee, writes to `rfid_ledger`
3. Laravel scheduled job (every 1 minute) polls `rfid_ledger` for new events
4. New events processed into `attendance_events` with deduplication
5. Daily summaries computed and stored in `daily_attendance_summary`
6. Events dispatched to Payroll, Appraisal, and Notification modules

**Ledger Schema (PostgreSQL):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE rfid_ledger (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sequence_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    employee_rfid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    device_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    scan_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'time_in', 'time_out', 'break_start', 'break_end'
    raw_payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    hash_chain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- SHA-256 hash of (prev_hash || payload)
    device_signature TEXT, -- Optional Ed25519 signature
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_rfid_ledger_sequence ON rfid_ledger(sequence_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_rfid_ledger_processed ON rfid_ledger(processed);
CREATE INDEX idx_rfid_ledger_employee ON rfid_ledger(employee_rfid);
```

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
- `AttendanceEventProcessed` → Triggers daily summary recomputation
- `AttendanceSummaryUpdated` → Notifies Payroll module
- `AttendanceViolation` → Alerts HR and updates Appraisal score
- `DeviceOfflineDetected` → Triggers admin notification
- `LedgerIntegrityFailed` → Blocks payroll processing, triggers audit

**Deduplication & Replay Logic:**
- 15-second window for duplicate tap detection (same employee, same device, same event type)
- Sequence gaps trigger automated replay jobs
- Hash chain validation on every ledger read
- Manual corrections logged with user ID and reason (never modify ledger, only override computed summaries)

**Workflow Gating:**
- Payroll approval blocked if ledger health check fails (gaps, hash mismatches, processing delays)
- Performance appraisal imports attendance data only from verified ledger sequences
- Manual corrections require HR Manager approval before affecting payroll

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### New Table: `rfid_ledger` (PostgreSQL)
Append-only ledger populated by FastAPI server. Never modified by Laravel.

```sql
CREATE TABLE rfid_ledger (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sequence_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    employee_rfid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    device_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    scan_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    raw_payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    hash_chain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    device_signature TEXT,
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Updated Table: `attendance_events`
Existing table modified to reference ledger and track processing status.

```sql
ALTER TABLE attendance_events ADD COLUMN ledger_sequence_id BIGINT REFERENCES rfid_ledger(sequence_id);
ALTER TABLE attendance_events ADD COLUMN is_deduplicated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE attendance_events ADD COLUMN duplicate_of_event_id BIGINT REFERENCES attendance_events(id);
ALTER TABLE attendance_events ADD COLUMN ledger_hash_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

### Updated Table: `daily_attendance_summary`
Add ledger integrity tracking.

```sql
ALTER TABLE daily_attendance_summary ADD COLUMN ledger_sequence_start BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE daily_attendance_summary ADD COLUMN ledger_sequence_end BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE daily_attendance_summary ADD COLUMN ledger_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

### New Table: `ledger_health_logs`
Track integrity checks and replay operations.

```sql
CREATE TABLE ledger_health_logs (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    check_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_sequence_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    gaps_detected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    gap_details JSON,
    hash_failures BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    hash_failure_details JSON,
    replay_triggered BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    status ENUM('healthy', 'warning', 'critical') NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 📦 Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Frontend Mockup - Overview Analytics & Ledger Page (Week 1)**

**Objective:** Create two distinct pages:
1. **Overview Page** (`/hr/timekeeping/overview`): High-level analytics, summary cards, ledger health widget
2. **Ledger Page** (`/hr/timekeeping/ledger`): Full replayable event stream, replay controls, device status

Mock data stored in controllers (MVC pattern), rendered via Inertia responses. No separate API service.

#### **Task 1.1: Create Time Logs Stream Component (For Ledger Page)**
**File:** `resources/js/components/timekeeping/time-logs-stream.tsx` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Display full chronological event stream on **Ledger page only** (not on Overview).

- [x] **1.1.2** Display each log entry with:
  - Employee photo/avatar
  - Employee name and ID
  - Event type badge (🟢 Time In, 🔴 Time Out, ☕ Break Start, ▶️ Break End)
  - Timestamp (e.g., "8:05 AM")
  - Device location (e.g., "Gate 1 - Main Entrance")
  - Sequence ID (e.g., "#12345")
  - Verification status icon (🔒 Verified / ⚠️ Pending)
- [x] **1.1.3** Use mock data array with 50+ sample events (various employees, times, events)
- [x] **1.1.4** Add auto-scroll animation (new events appear at top with slide-in effect)
- [x] **1.1.5** Add hover effect showing full event details tooltip
- [x] **1.1.6** Style with color coding: green (time in), red (time out), amber (breaks)
- [x] **1.1.7** Add "Live" indicator dot (pulsing green) in header

**Mock Data Structure:**
```typescript
const mockTimeLogs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    sequenceId: 12345,
    employeeId: "EMP-2024-001",
    employeeName: "Juan Dela Cruz",
    employeePhoto: "/avatars/juan.jpg",

    verified: true,
    hashChain: "a3f2b9c...",
    latencyMs: 125
  },
  // ... more mock entries
];
```

### **Phase 2: Controller Mock Data & Routes (Week 1-2)**

**Objective:** Create controllers with mock data following MVC pattern. No separate API service files.

#### **Task 2.1: Create Mock Data in Controllers**
**Files:** Controllers under `app/Http/Controllers/HR/Timekeeping/`

**Subtasks:**
- [x] **2.1.1** Update `AnalyticsController@overview()`: Add mock data for ledger health, summary stats, recent violations
- [x] **2.1.2** Create `LedgerController@index()`: Return Inertia response with paginated mock events (20/page)
- [x] **2.1.3** Create `LedgerController@show($sequenceId)`: Return Inertia response with single event detail
- [x] **2.1.4** Add mock data generators as private methods in controllers:
  - `generateMockTimeLogs()` → array of 50+ events
  - `generateMockLedgerHealth()` → health status object
  - `generateMockDeviceStatus()` → array of 5 devices
- [x] **2.1.5** Implement filter logic in `LedgerController@index()` (date, employee, device, event type)
- [x] **2.1.6** Implement pagination in controller (use `collect()->paginate(20)`)

**Example Mock Data Structure in Controller:**
```php
private function generateMockTimeLogs() {
    return collect([
        [
            'id' => 1,
            'sequence_id' => 12345,
            'employee_id' => 'EMP-001',
            'employee_name' => 'Juan Dela Cruz',
            'event_type' => 'time_in',
            'timestamp' => now()->subHours(2),
            'device_id' => 'GATE-01',
            'device_location' => 'Gate 1 - Main Entrance',
            'verified' => true,
        ],
        // ... more mock entries
    ]);
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mock data lives in controllers (not separate service files)
- Controllers return Inertia responses for pages
- Pagination and filters work server-side
- Mock data realistic (50+ events, multiple employees/devices)

---

#### **Task 2.2: Integrate Controllers with Pages (Inertia)**
**Files:** `Overview.tsx`, `Ledger.tsx`

**Subtasks:**
- [x] **2.2.1** Update `Overview.tsx` to receive props from `AnalyticsController@overview()`
- [x] **2.2.2** Create `Ledger.tsx` to receive props from `LedgerController@index()`

  - Indexes on `attendance_event_id`, `status`, `requested_by_user_id`

**Routes to Add in `routes/hr.php`:**
```php
// Attendance Correction API Routes (JSON endpoints)
Route::prefix('timekeeping/api/attendance/corrections')->name('timekeeping.api.attendance.corrections.')->group(function () {
    Route::post('/', [AttendanceCorrectionController::class, 'store'])
        ->middleware('permission:hr.timekeeping.corrections.create')
        ->name('store');
    
    Route::put('/{id}/approve', [AttendanceCorrectionController::class, 'approve'])

        ->name('approve');
    
    Route::put('/{id}/reject', [AttendanceCorrectionController::class, 'reject'])
        ->middleware('permission:hr.timekeeping.corrections.approve')
        ->name('reject');
});
```

**Route Pattern:**
- POST `/hr/timekeeping/api/attendance/corrections` → Submit correction request (JSON)
- PUT `/hr/timekeeping/api/attendance/corrections/{id}/approve` → Approve correction (JSON)
- PUT `/hr/timekeeping/api/attendance/corrections/{id}/reject` → Reject correction (JSON)

**Frontend Integration:**
- Update `attendance-correction-modal.tsx`:
  - Replace mock `handleSaveCorrection` with axios/fetch POST request
  - Use route: `route('hr.timekeeping.api.attendance.corrections.store')`
  - Handle validation errors and success responses
  - Show success toast on submission
- Uses `/api/` sub-namespace for JSON endpoints (consistent with ledger API routes)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Controller created with store(), approve(), reject() methods returning JSON responses
- [ ] Migration for attendance_corrections table created and run
- [ ] Routes added to hr.php with `/api/` sub-namespace (e.g., `/hr/timekeeping/api/attendance/corrections`)
- [ ] Permission checks applied to all routes
- [ ] Frontend modal integrates with real backend API via axios/fetch
- [ ] Audit trail captured for all correction actions
- [ ] Events dispatched for downstream processing (Payroll, Notifications)

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Architecture Decision**: Manual corrections NEVER modify the ledger or attendance_events
- **Data Integrity**: Corrections stored separately in `attendance_corrections` table
- **Audit Trail**: All correction requests logged with requestor, approver, timestamps, reasons
- **Workflow Gating**: Payroll processing checks for pending corrections and blocks approval
- **Event-Driven**: Correction approval triggers summary recomputation and payroll notification
