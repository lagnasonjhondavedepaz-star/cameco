## 📋 Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive Document Management System for HR Staff and HR Manager to digitize and manage employee 201 files and company documents required for Philippine labor law compliance. This system will replace manual paper-based filing with a secure, searchable digital repository.

**Core Objectives:**
1. Digitize employee 201 files with all required documents
2. Implement document templates with variable fields for common HR documents
3. Create document approval workflows (critical docs only)
4. Build document repository with audit logging
5. Ensure Philippine labor law compliance (5-year retention)
6. Provide document search and retrieval with employee self-service requests
7. Track document expiry dates with automated reminders
8. Support bulk document upload for migration of existing files

**Applied Implementation Decisions:**

**Storage & Security:**
- Store documents in Laravel's `storage/app/employee-documents/{employee_id}/{category}/{year}/`
- File limits: 10MB per file, 100MB total per employee
- Allowed formats: PDF (primary), JPEG/PNG (scanned), DOCX (editable)
- Retention policy: 5 years after employee separation (DOLE compliance)
- Soft delete with automatic archiving after retention period

**Access Control:**
- **HR Staff**: View/upload all employee documents
- **HR Manager**: View/upload/approve all employee documents
- **Employees**: View their own documents (read-only) + request documents via portal
- **Department Heads**: Future consideration (not in initial phase)

**Approval Workflow:**
- **Critical documents** (contracts, clearances, separation): HR Manager approval required
- **Personal documents** (IDs, certificates): Auto-approved upon upload
- Audit logging for: upload, download, approve, delete actions

**Compliance Features:**
- BIR Form 2316 copies stored in employee documents
- Automatic alerts for government ID expirations
- Annual medical certificate renewal reminders
- Document expiry tracking with 30-day advance warnings

**Enhanced Features (Implemented):**
- **Document Request System**: Employees can request COE, payslips via portal
- **Bulk Upload**: CSV-based bulk document upload for existing file migration
- **Expiry Reminders**: Automated email reminders for expiring documents (medical, NBI, licenses)
- **Template System**: 9 standard templates with variable fields (locked after approval)

### Phase 2: Frontend Pages - Dual-Interface Architecture (Week 2)
    - [ ] Generate: requested document
    - [ ] Upload: to employee documents
    - [ ] Update: request status, file_path
    - [ ] Notify: employee
    - [ ] Return: redirect with success message

---

### Phase 2: Frontend Pages - Dual Interface Architecture (Week 2)

**Goal:** Build React/TypeScript pages for document management using dual-interface approach

**Duration:** 5-7 days

**Status:** ⏳ Pending

**Architecture Decision:**
We implement TWO interfaces for different workflows:
1. **Employee Profile → Documents Tab**: Context-specific document management (already exists in `employee-documents-tab.tsx`)
2. **HR Sidebar → Documents Hub**: Centralized document management across ALL employees (NEW)

---

#### Task 2.1: Employee Profile Documents Tab - Backend Integration ✅ COMPLETED
**Location:** `/hr/employees/{id}` → Documents Tab (Tab already exists in `employee-documents-tab.tsx`)

- [x] Create backend API endpoints for employee-specific documents
  - [x] `GET /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents` - Fetch all documents for specific employee
  - [x] `POST /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents` - Upload document for specific employee
  - [x] `GET /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}` - Get document details
  - [x] `PUT /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}/approve` - Approve document
  - [x] `PUT /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}/reject` - Reject document
  - [x] `DELETE /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}` - Delete document
  - [x] `GET /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}/download` - Download document

  - [x] Location: `app/Http/Controllers/HR/Employee/EmployeeDocumentController.php`
  - [x] Methods: 7 API methods implemented
    - `index()` - Returns JSON array of documents with metadata and statistics
    - `store()` - Handles file upload with validation (max 10MB, PDF/JPG/PNG/DOCX)
    - `show()` - Returns document details with audit log
    - `approve()` - Changes status from pending to approved (HR Manager only)
    - `reject()` - Changes status from pending to rejected with reason (HR Manager only)
    - `destroy()` - Soft delete document with security logging
    - `download()` - Returns signed URL for file download (24-hour expiry)
  - [x] Scope: All methods filtered by employee_id from route parameter
  - [x] Authorization: Check HR permissions + employee exists (using Laravel policies)
  - [x] Security: LogsSecurityAudits trait for all actions
  - [x] Mock Data: 6 sample documents per employee for frontend development

- [x] Update `employee-documents-tab.tsx` component (Phase 2 Task 2.5) ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Replace mock data with actual API calls using `fetch` API
  - [x] Implement file upload with progress indicator
  - [x] Add real-time document status updates
  - [x] Integrate approval/rejection workflows
  - [x] Connect download functionality to backend
  - [x] Add useEffect hook to fetch documents on component mount
  - [x] Implement proper error handling with toast notifications
  - [x] Add CSRF token support for POST/PUT/DELETE requests

**Implementation Details:**
- **API Integration**: All mock `setTimeout` calls replaced with actual `fetch` API calls to backend endpoints
- **Upload Progress**: Real progress indicator with visual feedback (0-90% during upload, 100% on completion)
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- **CSRF Protection**: Added CSRF token from meta tag for all mutating requests (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic document list refresh after upload, approve, reject, or delete actions
- **Download**: Opens download URL in new window/tab via `window.open()`
- **Status Management**: Real-time status updates for pending/approved/rejected documents

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /hr/api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents` - Fetch all documents
- `POST /hr/api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents` - Upload document
- `GET /hr/api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}` - Get document details
- `PUT /hr/api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}/approve` - Approve document
- `PUT /hr/api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}/reject` - Reject document
- `DELETE /hr/api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents/{documentId}` - Delete document

        icon: FileText,
        href: '/hr/documents',
        permission: 'hr.documents.view',
      },
      {
        title: 'Templates',
        icon: FileSignature,
        href: '/hr/documents/templates',
        permission: 'hr.documents.templates.manage',
      },
      {
        title: 'Requests',
        icon: FileQuestion,
        href: '/hr/documents/requests',
        permission: 'hr.documents.view',
      },
    ];
    ```
  - [x] Permission-based filtering: `documentManagementItems` filters based on user permissions
  - [x] Active state detection: `isDocumentManagementActive` checks if current URL starts with `/hr/documents`
  - [x] Collapsible section: Integrates with existing sidebar collapse/expand pattern
  - [x] Default open: Section opens automatically when user is on documents pages

**Result**: ✓ Documents section added to HR navigation with 3 menu items, permission-based visibility, and proper active state highlighting.

    Body: { employee_numbers: string[] }
    Response: { valid: string[], invalid: string[] }
    
    // Upload single document
    POST /api/hr/employees/{employeeId}/documents
    Body: FormData { category, document_type, file, expires_at, notes }
    Response: { success: boolean, document_id: number, message: string }
    
    // Bulk upload (alternative: processes entire batch server-side)
    POST /api/hr/documents/bulk-upload
    Body: FormData { csv_file, zip_file }
    Response: { 
      success: boolean, 
      total: number, 
      success_count: number, 
      failed_count: number, 
      errors: Array<{ row: number, file: string, reason: string }> 
    }
    ```

**Implementation Priority:**
1. **Critical**: Step 1 instructions with downloadable CSV template
2. **Critical**: Step 2 CSV upload and validation
3. **Critical**: Step 3 ZIP upload and cross-validation
4. **Critical**: Step 4 progress tracking and results
5. **High**: Validation preview tables with error details
6. **Medium**: Retry failed uploads functionality
7. **Low**: Export options, processing time estimation

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] CSV template downloads correctly
- [ ] CSV validation catches all error types
- [ ] Invalid rows show appropriate error messages
- [ ] ZIP extraction lists all files
- [ ] Cross-validation detects missing files
- [ ] File size validation works (10MB per file, 100MB total)
- [ ] File type validation works (PDF/JPG/PNG/DOCX only)
- [ ] Progress bar updates in real-time
- [ ] Upload log shows live updates
- [ ] Failed uploads can be retried
- [ ] Success/error reports export correctly
- [ ] Wizard steps can navigate back
- [ ] Cancel button stops upload safely
- [ ] Email notifications sent to employees

**File Structure:**
```
resources/js/pages/HR/Documents/
  BulkUpload.tsx (main page, ~800 lines)

resources/js/components/hr/
  csv-validation-preview.tsx (~400 lines)
